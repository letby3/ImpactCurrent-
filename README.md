# ImpactCurrent-
This program is designed to calculate the lethal current of touch based on the data of the resistance of the human body, gender and other parameters of the system.
A small static program with a minimal level of pseudo-animation is presented.
Tkinter and a basic image are required to work.
All images are figurative and do not call for aggression. Were created at the request of the performer.
